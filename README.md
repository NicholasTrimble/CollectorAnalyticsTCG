CollectorAnalytics

CollectorAnalytics is a personal capstone project focused on exploring Magic: The Gathering card data and turning it into something useful from both a backend engineering and data analysis perspective. The project collects real card information from the Scryfall API, stores it locally in a SQLite database, and exposes it through a FastAPI backend. A separate Streamlit dashboard provides a user interface where data can be searched, filtered, visualized, and explored interactively. The idea behind the project was to start simple and expand step by step, eventually building a full end-to-end workflow that feels like a real production application rather than a small hobby script.

The backend handles fetching raw data, cleaning and transforming it, storing it efficiently, and making it queryable. All cleaned cards are stored in a local database, and the API supports search, filtering, sorting, pagination, and managing user favorites. The project originally started with a small dataset to avoid getting overwhelmed, then eventually expanded to include the full card history once the foundation was solid. It now supports tens of thousands of cards and performs well enough for local analysis and browsing.

The Streamlit dashboard is where the data becomes more interesting. It shows pricing trends, rarity breakdowns, top-valued cards, and gives users a way to explore individual cards including images and metadata. A watchlist feature is built in so certain cards can be flagged for later tracking. The UI is meant to feel simple, clean, and functional rather than flashy.

On the analytics side, the data has been used to explore patterns around pricing, rarity, set age, and card print cycles. After running the full dataset through analysis, a few interesting trends appeared. Most cards have little to no market value, while a very small group represents the majority of overall price weight. Older sets show steep price inflation due to scarcity and collector culture, while modern sets tend to have lower prices because they are printed in higher quantities. Mythic and rare cards tend to dominate the high-value range, although there are exceptions where older uncommons still hold value. Overall, working through the analytics portion helped validate the system and gave meaningful insight into how the MTG secondary market behaves.

The project is still open to expansions, such as scheduled refreshes, containerization, deployment, or additional data sources. For now, it serves as a solid demonstration of real-world skills including API integration, data cleaning and transformation, database design, backend development, and basic data visualization. More importantly, it represents steady, incremental development rather than trying to build everything at once.

If someone wants to run the project, the setup is straightforward. Clone the repository, create a virtual environment, install the requirements, run the API server, then launch the Streamlit dashboard. The system will load from the local database, and everything should work without needing external credentials. The entire project was built to be approachable, understandable, and expandable rather than fragile or over-engineered.
